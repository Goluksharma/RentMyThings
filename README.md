# RentMyThings
RentMyThing is a Spring Boot backend API developed to support a peer-to-peer rental platform, where users can rent or offer items, vehicles, and spaces for short-term use. The system enables geo-based matching of customers and sellers within a 5 km radius, making local rentals simple and efficient.
